## Supports Athena, Fusion, and Optifine-CTM based connected textures

This is mostly a building mod.

Little timmy implemented his blocks with mccreator, meanwhile I proceed to use whatever this is to make my blocks compatible with all both modloaders. In the end we both got the same result, **I lost.** 

This is not a codebase to take inspiration from or to be inspired by, unless you wish to take inspiration from this codebase.
